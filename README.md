# Facial Emotions Recognization using CNN in Keras

The package uses a convolutional neural network to classify images from files or from video/camera stream.

The faces are first detected using opencv, croped faces and we input the raw image data with the face landmarks into a 3 layered convolutional neural network.

Better to use anaconda environemnt to easily install the dependencies (especially opencv )
